               Mag-Tek NT KERNEL MODE DEVICE DRIVER

The Mag-Tek NT 4.0 driver resides in a file named MagEpNt.sys. It is a 
monolithic driver design accepting input from an application and sending 
data out to a device I/O port. Data received from an application is 
echoed back for diagnostic purposes and to aid in the development of a 
product. 

To install the Mag-Tek NT 4.0 driver product is very straight forward 
for a person accustomed to working with personal computers. We will 
describe the steps to follow, and taking the wrong turn is not going to 
bring your system down.

Manual Installation:

1.  Install MICRbase.
  
2.  Bring up the NT 4.0 Operating System.
 
3.  Copy the MagEpNt.sys file from folder MagEpNt, supplied with MICRbase,
    to the NT system driver folder. The NT driver files are located in 
    C:\Winnt\System32\Drivers. Your installation may have NT installed on 
    a different drive than our example.
 
4.  Open the folder MagEpNt, supplied with MICRbase, and run the
    program REGINI.EXE followed by a space then MagEpNt.ini. This will
    register your new driver into the system, it only has to be done once.
 
5.  Take NT down, and restart the NT operating system, observe any 
    informative system message that may appear. NT knows about your 
    driver and it is ready to run.  It is not operating yet because the 
    driver must manually be started. This manual feature prevents the 
    unknown from occurring to a new installation.
 
6.  To get your NT driver operating, click on the 
    start\settings\controlpanel and double click on devices. A device 
    dialog box appears and now you want to scroll down to the MagEpNt 
    device driver. Click on start and wait for the timer to go away and 
    you will see the device driver is now running. Your program now has 
    access to it. You may stop the device using the same technique.
